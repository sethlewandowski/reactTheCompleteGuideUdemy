Component driven development reduces repeated code

React is all about components 

Babel allows us to use jsx. which gets complied to normal html

var app = (<div>content here</div>)
ReactDOM.render(app, document.querySelector('#app'))

WHY REACT?
- UI state becomes difficult with vanilla js 
- 

React Alternatives:
- VUE
- Angular


TWO KINDS OF APPS:
- SPA vs MPA
SPA
- only one HTML page, content is rerendered on CLIENT
- typically only has one REACTDOM.render() call

MPA
- Multiple html pages, content rendered on SERVER
- one reactDOM.render() per 'widget'
