Webpack
- bundler 
- optimizes
- analyzes connections & bundles
- defacto standard for setting up projects

How it works: 
1. Needs one entry point (app.js for example)
2. Loaders (babel-loader or css-loader)
3. Plugins (uglify) Global transformations
4. Output (correctly ordered, concatenated output) (bundle.js)

Requirements
- want to complie to next gen js
- handle jsx
- css autoprefixing
- support image imports 
- optimize code
