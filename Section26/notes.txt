react hooks
- useBlank()
- highly reusable
- expose certain functionalities to functional components
- allow you to add state and lifcycle to functional components
- introduced with React 16.8
- can build custom hooks to share stateful or statless logic across multiple components

React Hooks have nothing to do with lifycle hooks (methods)
- called hooks because you hook something into a component

Lifecyle hooks are restircted to class based components

useState is the core hook 
- allows us to use state in func component

with empty array as useEffect second argument, it only runs once. If you add variable into dependency array, then it runs anytime a value in the array is changed.
