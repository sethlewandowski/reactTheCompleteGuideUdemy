react is all about rendering one component to the dom 
class app extends component means component is the parent class
app class has one method - render 
every component needs to have a render method in order to render html to the dom
- convention is to us js files 

jsx gets complied by this:
 return React.createElement('div', null, React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hi I'm react app'));

jsx restrictions:
- class can't be used. it's a reserved word thats why className
- jsx expressions must have one root element  
- return (
    <div>
        <h1>JSX here</h1>
    </div>
)
