with class state, it's one object with all state inside or one property
class Person extends Component {
    state = [
        {person: 'Seth'}   
    ],
    age: 28
}

with functional component state, you break it out individually so that when you update state you don't remove all prior states

const [person, setPerson] = useState({person: 'Seth'})
const [age, setAge] = useState({age: 28})
