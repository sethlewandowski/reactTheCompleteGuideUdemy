Server is typically a restful API. 

AXIOS - 3rd party js library for making http requests. 
- Github page is good starting point

npm install AXIOS --save // puts it in package json file as well

which lifecycle do we make http requests in ?
- ComponentDidMount() (used to fetch new data)

axios.get('urlForGetRequest') 
use axios github page for documentation 

get request happens asynchronously
axios uses promises to make their requests
get returns a promise so we can chain then on it.

axios.get('url.com').then(response => console.log(response))

initalize state and set it to empty posts
state = {
    posts: []
}

ComponentDidMount(){
    axios.get('url.com').then(response => {
        this.setState({posts: response.data})
    })
}
